    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>There's not much that I can say about myself, except I'm currently at loss to get what I want. There are a lot of things that I want to do and achieve but I spent to much time in things that doesn't really matters. I think I should start reducing my innecessary activites and start doing things that really matters.</p>
    <p>Currently I'm 32 years old. I will try to update this page whenever I could. I think this is a good start for me to improve myself. Life is really hard when you don't know what to do. I'll be stronger than before and actually make something that can make myself proud.</p>
